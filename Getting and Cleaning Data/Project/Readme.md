Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==

Overview
--
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the raw data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository ([here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)).

The source data for this project can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

Using this Script
--
Once you have obtained the source files, you will need to place the UCI HAR Dataset folder inside your working directory.

Project Requirements
--

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
1. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
